hey hi raj this msg for u because u find virtual server 
like not mantory for aws server because the linux server using all of the devops tools like jenkins,docker and etc


so now we talk about how to create virtual servers and its create for using docker

first u install docker 

pull docker file 

* sudo apt install docker.io
* docker pull ubuntu (u pull the ubuntu after u create container )
   * docker run -itd --name server1 ubuntu (if u have more server use this type of method)
   * docker exec -it server1 bash (now u run the virtual server , so u install these (apt install curl, apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre, apt install vim)

so u finish the steps for server now u go to master jenkins after u follow these steps

* Go to manage jenkins ->nodes -> new node (give node name) -> click permently agent and create
* number of executors -> 1
*remote root directoryu -> /home/jenkins (or) /opt/jenkins
*labels -> docker (u give like the project)
*usage -> use this node as much as possible
*launch method -> launch agent by connecting it to the controller

and save the node 

* after u use the cmd in master machine(wget http://master-ip:port-no/jnlpJars/agent.jar(the (agent.jar) its use ur project propbly name)

* after u save the node u see this type of msg 
(echo 95b0ba007c4c7fe7f237f0b40430c550de9a1ffae04ec556c3b6d276a9491811 > secret-file
curl -sO http://192.168.92.73:8081/jnlpJars/agent.jar
java -jar agent.jar -url http://192.168.92.73:8081/ -secret @secret-file -name "new-node" -webSocket -workDir "/opt/jenkins")

in this cmd u paste for slave machine like inside docker in ubuntu like this
(docker -> ubuntu -> install java -> set path (/opt/jenkins))
